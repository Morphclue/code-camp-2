# code-camp-2
This project was created as part of the master module Java Code-Camp Context Awareness 2.
The app developed here is intended to represent a beverage system that integrates functions that are provided by a server.
For more information, there is the [documentation](doc/documentation.pdf) written in German.
The basic architecture and screenshots are also documented there.
